- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I initially think it would lead to making new separate class that shares the same attributes as the previous class
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
At first it was hard to code the very last methods for library class so I asked for help from Emily. What didn't worked was that when I test the code, the lines were printed vertically not horizontally then I realized I didn't "ln" to print(": Available"). My advice is to ask for help.
